## Keylogger
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that is designed to record the keystrokes of a user without their knowledge. The term "keylogger" is a combination of "key" and "logger." Keyloggers are often used for various purposes, including monitoring computer or network activity, capturing sensitive information such as login credentials, and in some cases, for malicious activities like identity theft or espionage.

For this case, the keylogger I have created is only used for capturing and tracing the input keys from the keyboard. By running keylogger.py, every keys that is pressed will be converted into a string format and recorded on a text file called "keytext.txt". To halt the keylogger, simply press the "Esc" key. Note that to run the program, pynput has to be installed (run "pip install pynput" in the termninal). 

This project was greatly inspired by the sources I have found on youtube and google such as  [Keylogger](https://github.com/rahulsinghinfosec/keylogger/blob/master/README.md)
